\# Simple Windows C Experiment (Zipicorn)



This is a small C program I wrote to get more familiar with how C works,

particularly input handling and console behavior. It is intended for learning

purposes only and is \*\*not suitable for production use\*\*.



\## Requirements

\- Windows OS



\## Program



You can download the program using the releases feature in GitHub, or manually compile it.
